# Game Of life #
Version 0.3, by Emmanuel “Daïmanu” DI CLEMENTE

Simple implementation of Conway's game of life using C++ and the ncurses library.

## Warnings ##
To compile the code, you need a C++11 compiler implementing threads, lambdas, random and smart pointers.
This game shows unicode characters (“U+2588 FULL BLOCK” and “U+00D7 MULTIPLICATION SIGN”), please make sure your terminal is able to print them.

## Future releases and TODO ##
Allow custom grid size and content.
Custom parameters in .ini file.
